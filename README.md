- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @VicNeto I'm a software developer, for now mainly working as a Backend developer building web apps logic.
- ðŸ‘€ My main interest is about software in general and not only web development, I really hope some day to have the opportunity of working on some kind of systems programming.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ... well a bit of a lot of things, may be not the best idea if you want to get better on some topic.

- ðŸ“« In the strange case that you want to ping me, just send an email victor.nedi@gmail.com (currently working on my personal website and domain, my biggest headache)
